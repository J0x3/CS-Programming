git clone (repo)
git add . -A
git commit -m "...."
git push origin "branch"
git pull origin "branch"
git checkout -b "name of branch"


ex.
//make a copy of the repository
git clone https://github.com/VCCCD-CS-V13/class-collaboration.git
//make changes to files or whatever in folder
//then use next command to add changes
git add. -A
//use next command to commit changes and add a message
git commit -m "these are my changes or added file such and such"
//then you have to use the push command to send the data back to the repository
//the last word should be name of branch or master if none
git push origin master

//to create a branch you clone first
//then checkout and give branch a name
git checkout -b name-of-branch
//save changes by pushing
git add . -A
git commit -m "message here"
git push origin name-of-branch


//then to pull new changes from repo, use pull command (opposite of push)
git pull origin name-of-branch
